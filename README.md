# Functions-Using-Pointers-As-Arguments
Several functions that process strings using pointers as arguments

This program is packed full of a bunch of string processing functions that print out in the order from top to bottom of the function prototypes on the .c file. 

The first function upperLower simply prints the string in all uppercase and again in all lowercase.

The second function convertStrtoInt sums up 4 strings with integers inside them and returns the total as an integer.

The third function convertStrtoFloat is similar to the previous function but returns the total as a float.

The fourth function compareStr returns the larger of the two strings.

The fifth function ComparePartialStr compares portions of strings.

The sixth function randomize creates a random story using a series of randomly generated articles, nouns, verbs, and prepositions. However, it is really just a bunch of random sentences one after the other.

The seventh function tokenizeTelNum splits up a phone number into tokens.

The eighth function reverse returns a sentence with its words reversed.

The ninth function countSubstr counts the number of substrings.

The tenth function countChar returns the number of characters.

The eleventh function countAlpha counts each letter of the alphabet that occurs in a string and returns the value for each letter in a list format.

The twelfth function countWords simply counts the number of words in a string.

The thirteenth function startsWithB sorts through strings to see which strings start with 'b' or 'B' and returns them.

The fourteenth and final function endsWithed sorts through strings to find which strings end with 'ed' and returns them.
